# tic-tac-toe

A browser project to simulate tic-tac-toe.

Utilize Javascript to create factory functions and modules to simulate a 
game of tic-tac-toe. Modules were used for the game and board, while factory functions
were used for players. This project also utilizes some HTML and CSS, with a lot of 
DOM elements from the javascript.
